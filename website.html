<p>
  today marks two months in Paraguay. woohoo.  
  i am still weighing the merits of cutting off all communication with the outside world for these two years.
</p>

<p>
  clearly i have not yet decided to follow through with it.
</p>

<p>
  as an update, i have gotten lots of reading done down here. 
  clearly i have learned at least a little bit about HTML and CSS in my free time. but many things are different.
</p>

<p>
  turns out the family that i will live with at least temporarily once i move out to my site in mid-December is very politically active.
  <p>


  </p> and signs cover many of the walls and every night we listen to the propoganda jingle for el partido colorado for at least 30 minutes in a row.
</p>

<p>
  but they are still overall good people
</p>

<p>
  that has not kept me from daydreaming about when i move in to my own place after my sojourn with them.  <p>

  </p>i want to make my own kimchi when i move out to my own place because there is cabbage everywhere and I have been kind of tired of the usual flavors here for a while. <p>

  </p>
  i'm thinking some pickled vegetables could change my outlook on life
  <p>
  
    <p>also, the button is active</p>
